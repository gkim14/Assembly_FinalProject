# Text-Based RPG
This is a little game made in C++ by Grace Kim and Jonathan Brough for our Assembly Project. 

The battle system is still mostly a placeholder screen, and the walls are randomly generated so a reset may be required.

## How to Run the game
The game can be compiled and run in the terminal with:

```
g++ -o game game.cpp -lncurses
./game
```

## How to Play
The player character is [@]. Enemy characters are [#]. 

Move with [WASD]. Exit with [ESC]. 

Move the player character around to the enemy to start a battle.
